Usage
-----
Select a sketch point and insert a 3D QR code.

You can either generate a QR code from an input string with various options or you can import a csv file.

Create QR Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This command will generate a QR code from the input message.  It is based on the **PyQRCode** Package.

See the `full PyQRCode documentation <https://pythonhosted.org/PyQRCode/>`_
for a detailed description of the available encoding options.

In general you select a sketch point for the center then define the block size and the height.
The different options determine exactly how the QR code will be constructed.


Import QR Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This command allows you to import a QR code generated via another program.

The data should be formatted as a csv file.
Each row of the file corresponds to a row of block data in the resulting QR code.  The format should be 1's and 0's.
A value of 1 indicates that the block should be created for this position.


Installation
------------
- `Download or clone the latest version <https://github.com/Impacto0/QRCoder/archive/refs/heads/master.zip>`_
- Unzip the archive to a permanent location on your computer
- It is important that the directory be named *QRCoder*.

*Note: If you are downloading the zip file from github it typically appends -master to the folder name.
You must rename the folder for Fusion 360 to recognize the addin.*

After you download and extract the zip file:

1.	Open the scripts and add-ins dialog box
2.	Select the add-ins tab in the top of the dialog
3.	Click the little green plus button to add the add-in
4.	Select the directory named Export2D and click the open button
5.	With it selected click the run button at the bottom of the dialog

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Credit where credit is due!!!

This sample add-in is built upon the `pyqrcode library <https://github.com/mnooner256/pyqrcode>`_

The first time you run the application, depending how you downloaded it,
you may be prompted to install a couple of dependencies:

The required dependency **PyQRCode** from the standard python package index: PyPI
